  <p>For this assignment, I took a look at the Chicago Public Library’s (CPL) Website. I have looked through their event pages before for ideas for my library, but I have never really explored their website. It has been easy for me to access and explore, but I wanted to see what they were doing that was working and what they might be able to improve upon. I looked at this site as someone who is not a patron of this library. There is a section of the site I could not view because I was not a patron and did not have an account to access. </p>

<h2>The Surface Plane: Sensory Design</h2>
<p>When I go to their website, the first thing I see are the movie and TV staff picks for October with images of some of the material above and a link to the entire list below. My eye is then drawn to the left side of the page. Here are more images of covers, but these are for November staff picks and Chicago Humanities Festival 2019 Authors below. I then look to the right side of the page where there are blog and news posts related to the library, and finally I look at the top of the page where my navigational options are. </p>
<p>The site has a white background with consistent black typography, which makes it easy to see and really makes the covers of the advertised material really pop. As I scroll down, there is an explore CPL and CPL events. Below the events page there are color coded buttons designating colors to various age groups: blue for adults, orange for kids, and green for teens. These are used further down to indicate sections of the page that are for these age groups. These colors are helpful, but got confusing as I went further down that page. Purple started showing up to highlight various elements and it just left me a little confused and felt like it did not fit. There was no consistency for when it was used. I navigated to each of the linked age group pages and the color scheme was dropped completely. The pages were all back to the uniform black and white, which is consistent with the rest of the site, but I would have liked the reinforcement of the color choice of the different adult, teen, and kids pages. The general use of black and white throughout the site creates a sense of intentional coherency and allows any pop of color to instantly draw the eye. I just think there should be more consistency and thought to how each color is used. </p>
<p>The site is consistently uniform and things do not feel jarringly out of place or overwhelming. As I navigated to different pages, I noticed that they always use the same font, which is the same font as their logo. This was a nice consistency and kept the pages from feeling too busy, even the ones with a lot of various information on them. </p>
<p>There were a lot of links to books throughout the site, but I did not notice any clear way to access the catalog, without clicking on one of those books first. I then realized that the search feature, at the top of the page, lets you search several features of the website including the catalog. I like the search options, but it did take me a couple clicks to understand that it also allowed me to search the catalog. This feature, or general access to the catalog, should be more prominent on their website.</p>
<p>Overall, there is consistency throughout the website and they use images and color in a seemingly intentional way to draw attention to certain features and to organize the information shown. There are some odd uses of color that I could not place, but the overall cohesion of the website was solid. </p>

<h2>The Skeleton Plane: Interface, Navigation, and Information Design</h2>
<p>Looking beyond the surface images, the site’s structure really shows how intuitively navigable the site is. This site seems to be thoughtfully constructed with a lot of helpful features places strategically to increase interest in material and events at the library. </p>
<p>The first structural component I noticed was the global navigation bar at the top. This bar was a constant option on every page which created consistency and allowed me to feel that I was not going to get lost if I got too deep into the site. However, this feature did not work to take me back to the home page when I was in their store. It took me back to the storefront page rather than the homepage, which was frustrating. There is a search feature in the global navigation that allows users to search the entire site by category. You also have the option to log into your account from here as well. </p>
<p>This site seems to function mainly through global navigation with each tab or link taking you to a specific page on the site. There is very little side to side movement between pages. The catalog does allow you to see similar items as well as items that would be shelved close to the item you are looking at, but this is the only place you see this feature on the site. There are a lot of Blog posts featured on the site. These link you items in the catalog that might be of interest to those who are interested in the blog post. I did see contextual navigation utilized within the blog posts, but everything linked within the blog was also linked as a larger icon with more descriptors below. </p>
<p>The part that seems to be lacking the most on this site is the information design, especially on the homepage. As I mentioned above, there is no obvious way to reach the catalog without going through several pages. It is possible to search the catalog through the search bar in the global navigation, but you have to click in the search bar and then use the drop down feature that appears to find that option. You can access the catalog by format under the browse option in the global navigation, but again, there is no simple ‘catalog’ button. The user has to intuitively know to use the browse or search feature. </p>
<p>The website’s homepage was also really lacking in structure and did not seem to support wayfinding.  Past the ‘we recommend’ section, I felt that there was little structure to how things were listed. There seemed to be random blog posts mixed in with events for all ages. It felt more like a dumping ground for advertising than a structured informational design. Once the user reaches a blog post, event page, or catalog entry, wayfinding feels more supported. There are ‘like links’ and access to more information, as well as a way back. The like pages all seem to have the same wireframing, which makes them easy to use. It just feels like they missed that structure here on the homepage. </p>
<p>Overall the skeleton plane of this site is clean and fairly intuitive, once you get past the homepage.</p>

<h2>The Structure Plane: Interaction, Design, and Information Architecture </h2>
<p>This site uses structure to promote events and material effectively and ensure the user’s experience is fluid and easy. The Chicago Public Library’s site manages information for their 80 branches, so it is very important that their website maintain its structure and deliver information clearly, consistently effectively to its users.</p>
<p>This site seems to use a matrix structure. You can go into certain areas of the site, but you have to return to a previous screen to go somewhere else on the site. You can navigate through to similar features or catalog entries, but there is no real side to side link, only going further into the site. This allows users to find more and more information that is pertinent to them. </p>
<p>This site really emphasizes book and event advertising. If you click on an event, the site makes it easy for you to find other events hosted by the library, or to limit your search to event types or age groups. This makes it easy for users to find and view events that might interest them. </p>
<p>There are also book recommendations all over the site. This shows the importance of advertising and circulating material to the users of the site. All books are linked to their entry in the catalog where patrons can see if it is in, place a hold on it, and view many other details about the book. The structure of the site seems to be built around advertising library features and the collection. Almost every page I visited linked to another page that had information about one of the two. The site seems to be clearly structured with the intent to bring the use clear information that also advertises other new things at the library related to what the visitor showed interest in.  </p>

<h2>The Scope Plane</h2>
<p>The Chicago Public Library’s website is clearly designed to support advertisement of their collection as well as library events. If it is not a library event advertisement, it has a book linked that has something to do with the post. All books listed on their website are linked back to the catalog. Everything on their site seems to be motivated by their events and collection. </p>
<p>While this site might seem to be a little inconsistent with where things go, it seems to have a clear definition of the scope of the website. There is consistency with how books are listed in all their recommendation lists with cover images on the left and a summary on the right and the option to place the book on hold in the bottom right corner. All of these lists look exactly the same and all the images of the book covers link back to the book’s entry in their catalog. Blog posts are similarly consistent across the site. This is obviously a set scope throughout the site to make it as easy as possible for the user to find and access new material from the library that might interest them. </p>
<p>Events are similarly cohesive. They all have an image that pertains to the upcoming event, to help catch the eye and they all list that age group the event is intended for before you even click on the event. Once you navigate to the event there is more information about what it is and where it is being held. There is also information about the library hosting the event, including address, hours, and a map. This helps make it easy for patrons to be drawn in by an event and find the information they need to attend an event they are interested in. </p>
<p>This one site is working to inform users about what is happening and available at 80 different locations throughout the city. All on this one site. Consistency in the presentation of the information given is vital as to not frustrate the user. How they work to highlight where the event or book is in the city and allowing patrons to search for things by location reliably is vital to not confusing or frustrating the user. This website functions on a more complicated level than many public library websites, where there could be several branches, but often no more than ten. The scope of this site seems to be clearly identified and managed throughout the site. The motivation clearly influences the design choices and the scope of the website clearly works to achieve those goals.</p>

<h2>The Strategy Plane</h2>
<p>The Chicago Public Library’s website seems to have a very clear goal for the website. It works to provide the user with information on what is available and going on at all 80 public library locations. The site seems to work to bring the various branches together. The material and events are listed as a whole with the current location highlighted. At its core, this site seems to work to create a cohesion within this library system. </p>
<p>The site seems geared toward those living in Chicago, based on highlighted news stories and blog posts, and is really geared toward patrons of the library. The site’s crisp look and lack of drastic colors not only serves their use of using book covers and other images to guide the user’s eye, but also creates a site that most people could use. This site could work for patrons that might have eye trouble or might not be familiar with computers. This sight seems to want to appeal to as many people who are living in the area as possible. It does require some intuition on the user’s part to find some of the features, so I think the creators are assuming the visitors understand basic computer features, but there are enough ways to accidentally click somewhere and end up in the catalog or on the calendar page that they created a clear fail safe for those with less experience. </p>

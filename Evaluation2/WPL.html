    <p>The Waterloo Public Library’s website is structured to serve the differing needs of various populations. It has many components that work to serve these population’s needs. These components are clearly marked by color and organized by intended use. The website is clearly laid out very clean. It is minimalistic, but I found enough information there to satisfy the general public library user. The main components I identified are:
</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Catalog Access</li>
          <li>Account Access</li>
          <li>Contact Information</li>
          <li>Website Tabs</li>
          <li>Events Slideshow</li>
          <li>Digital Collection</li>
          <li>Learn: Reference</li>
          <li>Youth</li>
          <li>Lirbary Information</li>
          <li>Link to City Website</li>
        </ul>


<p>These components are highlighted by the change in color between sections. These components each serve a certain population of patrons by fulfilling certain tasks for those patrons. Those tasks are: </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Collection Informaiton</li>
          <li>Patron Account Access</li>
          <li>Library Promotion</li>
          <li>Adult and Reference Services</li>
          <li>Youh Services</li>
          </ul>

<p>The library’s website is focused on serving the Waterloo, Iowa population with a focus on those who are patrons of the library. There are certain features of the website that you need a library card to access, but there is a decent amount of information available to those without one. The tasks listed above are clearly fulfilled by the components of the website.</p>

There are certain features of the website that you need a library card to access, but there is a decent amount of information available to those without one. The tasks listed above are clearly fulfilled by the components of the website.</p>

<p>The first component allows patrons to search the physical collection of the library as well as access their account online to reserve items and manage their information. This service applies to any patron of the Waterloo Public Library, who has access to a computer. The tabs below the top section allow for further website navigation, including to the library’s calendar. This component also contains links to the various social media accounts for the library, if the visitor would rather keep up with events that way. The slideshow below that also features a link to the larger calendar and then goes on to show prominent events in the library. Further down, there is a section devoted to the digital collection. All of these services require a library card to access and are meant for patrons of the library. Below this is a section titled ‘learn.’ This section is devoted to those who wish to do research or utilize their reference services. These include most adult services, including their technology classes and genealogy tools. There is also a link to email a librarian with a question you might have. The penultimate component is for youth services. It contains links to youth specific programming and information, as well as a link for teacher services. The last section is dedicated information on the library, including hours, address, phone numbers, and other general information.</p>

<p>After reviewing these components, it seems that this website is geared toward the patrons of the Waterloo Public Library, no matter who that is. There are services for children and adults in Waterloo and databases and digital collections for those who cannot come into the library, but have a library card. The library is definitely intended for patrons of the library, especially those who live in the Waterloo area.</p>
